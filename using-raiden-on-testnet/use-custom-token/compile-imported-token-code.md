# Compile Imported Token Code

Click on the icon underneath the **"FILE EXPLORER"** in the left hand side menu to view the **"SOLIDITY COMPILER"**.

![Screen for compiling custom token code](../../.gitbook/assets/remix_compile2.png)

In the compiler you need to:

1. Select **"0.5.4+commit..."** from the "Compiler" dropdown.
2. Click on **"Compile CustomErc20Token.sol"**.

This will compile the token code and once the compiling step is done you're ready to deploy your custom token.
