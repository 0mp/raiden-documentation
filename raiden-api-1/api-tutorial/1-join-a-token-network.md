# Join a Token Network

## Check if the token is registered

Before you can join a token network you need to determine whether the token has been registered and a network for the token has been created.

We can verify this by making a query to the [`tokens`](../resources/tokens.md#addresses-for-all-registered-tokens) endpoint.

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:5001/api/v1/tokens
```

If the address exists in the list returned by the response you can go ahead and [join the already existing token network](1-join-a-token-network.md#join-an-existing-token-network).

If the address is not in the list you'll have to [register the token](1-join-a-token-network.md#register-a-new-token-and-join-its-network) before joining its network.

## Register a new token and join its network

Registering a new token is as simple as calling the [`tokens`](../resources/tokens.md#register-a-token) endpoint with a PUT request while providing the address of the token you want to register as a path parameter.

```bash
curl -i -X PUT \http://localhost:5001/api/v1/tokens/0x9aBa529db3FF2D8409A1da4C9eB148879b046700 \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

If the call is successful the response will return a new address of the now newly created token network.

```bash
HTTP:/1.1 201 CREATED
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "token_network_address": "0xC4F8393fb7971E8B299bC1b302F85BfFB3a1275a"
}
```

Because this token was just registered by you, no one else will be connected to its network and you'll have to open a channel with another Raiden node.

Payment channels between parties are opened in token networks.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Registering a new token is currently only relevant on the testnets. The tokens allowed on the mainnet for the Alderaan release are DAI and W-ETH. At some point in future, you will be able to register new token networks for the Ethereum mainnet, too.
{% endhint %}

## Join an existing token network

Joining the network of a token that has already been registered is the most common way of connecting to a token network.

For this, the [`connections`](../resources/connections.md#join-a-token-network) endpoint with a PUT request can be used and all you need to provide is:

1. The address of the token whose network you want to join as a path parameter.
2. The amount of tokens you want to deposit in the channel as a body parameter.

```bash
curl -i -X PUT \http://localhost:5001/api/v1/connections/0x9aBa529db3FF2D8409A1da4C9eB148879b046700 \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"funds": 2000}'
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
In its current implementation the connection manager that is used for opening channels might also connect you with nodes that happen to be offline.

That won't be much of a help for sending payments. So if you already know the address of a node you'd like to send payments to you can join the token network by [opening a channel directly with that node](2-open-a-channel.md).
{% endhint %}

In the example above we'll assume a connection was successfully made to the network of token `0x9aBa529db3FF2D8409A1da4C9eB148879b046700` by depositing 2000 tokens.

Three channels were also automatically opened with three random nodes and 20% of the 2000 tokens were deposited in each channel with the remaining 40% reserved for whenever you want to open a channel with another node or top up a channel.

Your node should now be well connected and you can jump ahead and start making payments. If you want, you could also choose to open a channel with a friend's node.
