  By making a withdraw you can claim tokens back out of a channel on your
  account without having to close the channel itself.

# Withdraw Tokens

Similar to depositing, a PATCH call to the [channel](../resources/channels.md#withdraw-tokens) endpoint is used  for withdrawing with the difference that a value for `total_withdraw` is provided in the request body.

So, whenever you'd like to make a withdraw your request needs to include:

1. The token address as a path parameter.
2. The address of the node you have the channel with as a path parameter.
3. The amount of tokens you want to withdraw as a body parameter.

```bash
curl -i -X PATCH \
http://localhost:5001/api/v1/channels/0x9aBa529db3FF2D8409A1da4C9eB148879b046700/0x61C808D82A3Ac53231750daDc13c777b59310bD9 \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"total_withdraw": 200}'
```

In the next section we will take a look at how to withdraw all tokens for a channel and how to leave a token network completely.
