# Send tokens back on-chain

## Send tokens back on-chain

You have a couple of ways for sending tokens back on-chain

* [Withdraw tokens](./#withdraw-tokens)
* [Close a channel](./#close-a-channel)
* [Leave a network](./#leave-a-network)

### Withdraw Tokens

Especially, if you receive tokens, you can get them back on-chain by withdrawing them

1. Click the **"WITHDRAW"** button in the respective **"Channel"** 
2. Enter the amount for your withdraw
3. Click **"Confirm"**. 
4. The token amount will be added to your total token network balance.

### Close a Channel

If you want to get all your tokens back on-chain and don't plan to use the channel any more, you can close it.

![](../.gitbook/assets/web_ui_close_channel.png)

1. Click the **"CLOSE"** button in the **"Channels"** screen next to the channel you wish to close. 
2. Click **"Confirm"** the channel will get closed and no longer be available for making payments. 
3. The token amount will be payed out in accordance to the transactions that have been made between the channel participants.

### Leave a Network

If you don't plan to make any more transfers with this token, you can leave the token network.

1. Click the **"LEAVE NETWORK"** button in the **"Tokens"** screen next to the token network you wish to leave. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**What happens, if I leave a network?**

Leaving a network has the same outcome as [closing an individual channel](./#close-a-channel) with the difference that _all_ channels for the network you're leaving get closed.
