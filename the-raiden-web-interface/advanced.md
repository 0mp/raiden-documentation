# Add tokens

## Register a New Token and Join Its Network

If you want to make transfers with a token you are not already connected to, you can connect to a new token network

Enter the address of the token you want to register and click **"Register"**.

## Add More Tokens **to all channels**

You have two ways of allocating more tokens to your channels:

Click the **"ADD FUNDS"** button in the **"Tokens"** screen next to the token network you want to allocate more tokens for. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The number of tokens you provide needs to be higher than the amount currently allocated. 

Say you already have 10 tokens, your new amount then needs to exceed this number. This is because the sum gets redistributed across your open channels and if you were to provide the same amount there isn't really anything new to redistribute.
{% endhint %}

Click the **"DEPOSIT"** button in the **"Channels"** screen next to the channel you want to deposit more tokens in. This gives you the option to allocate any number of tokens to a specific channel only instead of distributing the amount across all your channels.

**Minting tokens**

The Raiden WebUI lets you mint tokens if you need to fund your account with additional testnet tokens.

To do so, simply click the **"MINT TOKEN"** button in the **"Tokens"** screen next to your token of choice.

This will trigger an on-chain transaction and use some of you ETH in exchange for more tokens.
