**Why do I need Infura?**

The Raiden Wizard aims to make installing Raiden as easy as possible. By using Infura you don't have to worry about layer 1, that is running your own synced Ethereum node. You can simply access all testnets and the Ethereum mainnet through the API endpoints provided by Infura.
{% endhint %}

To get an Infura project ID:

1. Visit [infura.io](https://infura.io/) and sign up for a new account.
2. Create a new project.
3. View your project and you'll find the project ID under the **KEYS** tab.
