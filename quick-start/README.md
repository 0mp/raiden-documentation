## **Setup and Run a Raiden Node**

{% hint style="warning" %}
You need to have an internet connection to run the Raiden Wizard. The Wizard will launch in your default browser.

The setup process can take up to five minutes, make sure not to close the browser.
{% endhint %}

1. Extract and open the **Raiden Wizard** file.
2. Insert your Infura Project ID. Don't have a Infura Project ID? Learn how to [get one here](./#get-an-infura-project-id).
3. Click **"Create New Configuration"** to configure, install and launch the latest Raiden.
