# Deposit Tokens

You deposit in a channel by making a PATCH request to the [`channels`](../raiden-api-1/resources/channels.md#increase-deposit) endpoint that includes:

1. The address of the W-ETH token as a path parameter.
2. The address of the partner node as a path parameter.
3. The amount of tokens you want to deposit in the channel as a body parameter.

```text
curl -i -X PATCH \
http://localhost:5001/api/v1/channels/0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-raw '{"total_deposit":"4000"}'
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Notice how we are specifying the `total_deposit` in the request and not only the amount we want to "top-up" with. This means that if we initially deposited

2000 WEI and want to increase the amount with 2000 we would need to make a total deposit of 4000 WEI.

This is done to prevent requests that are sent repeatedly \(by accident or as part of an attack\) from having any further consequences.
