  We will be using MetaMask for the blockchain transactions and to deploy our
  custom token on the Goerli testnet. However, any other Ethereum client can be
  used.

# Get MetaMask and Ethereum Account

Before deploying the custom token you first need to:

* [Install MetaMask](get-metamask-and-ethereum-account.md#install-metamask)
* [Create an Ethereum Account](get-metamask-and-ethereum-account.md#create-an-ethereum-account)

## Install MetaMask

To install MetaMask:

1. Visit the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/).
2. Follow the instructions to add MetaMask as a browser extension.
3. Restart your browser. You should now see the MetaMask icon in the top right corner of your browser.

## Create an Ethereum account

With the newly installed MetaMask extension click the icon in your browser. This will open up MetaMask with a setup guide for creating a new account \(wallet\).

After following the instuctions you should see a screen with information about your newly created Ethereum account.
