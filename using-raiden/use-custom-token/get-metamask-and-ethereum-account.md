# Get MetaMask and Ethereum Account

## Install MetaMask

MetaMask is an in-browser Ethereum wallet. It allows you to send Ethereum transactions and is necessary for starting to use Ethereum.

To install MetaMask:

1. Visit the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/).
2. Follow the instructions to add MetaMask as a browser extension.
3. Restart your browser. You should now see the MetaMask icon in the top right corner of your browser.

## Create an Ethereum account

With the newly installed MetaMask extension click the icon in your browser. This will open up MetaMask with a setup guide for creating a new account \(wallet\).

After following the instructions you should see a screen with information about your newly created Ethereum account.
