# The Raiden Web Application

* [Join a token network](the-raiden-web-interface.md#join-a-token-network-1)
* [Make a payment](the-raiden-web-interface.md#make-a-payment)

### Join a Token Network

You need to join a token network for the token you're interested in doing payments with. To do so, navigate to the **"Tokens"** screen where you can choose to either:

* [Join an existing token network](the-raiden-web-interface.md#join-an-existing-token-network)
* [Register a new token and join its network](the-raiden-web-interface.md#register-a-new-token-and-join-its-network)

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is a token network?**
{% endhint %}

#### Join an Existing Token Network

1. Click the **"JOIN NETWORK"** button next to the token which network you want to join.
2. Enter the the amount of tokens you want to allocate and click **"Join"**. The amount you choose is what will be available for making payments and you can always [add more funds later](the-raiden-web-interface.md#add-more-tokens).

You're now ready to [make a payment](the-raiden-web-interface.md#make-a-payment)!

#### Register a New Token and Join Its Network

1. Click the upper right **"+"** button.
2. Enter the address of the token you want to register and click **"Register"**.

You're now ready to [make a payment](the-raiden-web-interface.md#make-a-payment)!

### Make a Payment

When you joined a token network three channels were automatically opened with three random nodes and you now have a possibility to start making payments.

Let's walk through how to:

* [Pay from the tokens screen](the-raiden-web-interface.md#pay-from-the-tokens-screen)
* [Add more tokens](the-raiden-web-interface.md#add-more-tokens)

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is a channel? &lt;-- WORK MORE ON**

A channel or payment channel allows Raiden transfers to be made back and forth between parties without involving the actual blockchain.

This works by first creating an initial on-chain deposit with the amount you specified when for instance joining a token network. 60% of that amount gets evenly distributed across the three channels \(20% per channel\) and the remaining 40% are reserved for when someone wants to open a channel with us.

The net sum can then be used in the Raiden off-chain transactions and the actual blockchain only needs to be involved in the initial setup or if we choose to deposit more tokens or settle a netted amount.

In Raiden theses channels make up routes from which transfers can be made this means that two peers do not have to have a direct connection to send payments between each other as long as there are some routes connecting them.
{% endhint %}

#### Pay from the Tokens Screen

1. Click the **"PAY"** button that has now been made available for the token network you've joined.
2. In the popup dialogue:
   * Enter the address for the receiver for your payment.
   * Select the token associate with the token network you're making the payment from.
   * Enter the amount you want to pay.
   * You can choose to fill in any number in the **"Set payment identifier"** dropdown for identifying your payment. If nothing is provided your payment identifier will default to a timestamp.
   * Click **"Send"** to complete your payment.

#### Pay from the Channels Screen

1. Press either the **"PAY"** button or the **"SEND TOKENS"** button. Both will bring up the same pay popup dialogue with the difference that the **"PAY"** button gives you some pre-filled values
2. In the pay popup dialogue:
   * Enter the address of the one who will be receiving your payment
   * Select the token associated with the token network your channel belongs to
   * Enter the payment amount
   * You can choose to fill in any number in the **"Set payment identifier"** dropdown for identifying your payment. If no number is provided your payment identifier will default to a timestamp
   * Click **"Send"** to complete your payment

#### Add Funds

You have two alternatives for allocating more tokens:

1. Click the **"ADD FUNDS"** button next to the token network you want to allocate more tokens for. You have to provide a higher amount than previously, if you initially provided 10 tokens the new amount needs to exceed that number
2. Click the **"DEPOSIT"** button for a channel to add a token amount of your choosing to that specific channel

![](.gitbook/assets/web_ui_deposit_funds.png)

### Close and Settle

You have a couple of options for depositing tokens back to your token network balance:

* [Withdraw tokens](the-raiden-web-interface.md#withdraw-tokens)
* [Close a channel and settle the token amount](the-raiden-web-interface.md#close-a-channel-and-settle-the-token-amount)
* [Leave a token network, close all channels and settle the token amount](the-raiden-web-interface.md#leave-a-token-network-close-all-channels-and-settle-the-token-amount)

#### Withdraw Tokens

1. Click the **"WITHDRAW"** button for the channel you'd like to withdraw tokens from
2. Enter the amount you wish to withdraw based on the current balance for that specific channel and click **"Confirm"**. The amount will be returned to your token network balance

#### Close a Channel and Settle the Token Amount

1. Click the **"CLOSE"** button for the channel you'd like to close
2. Click **"Confirm"** to finalize closing the channel. When a channel has been closed no more payments can be carried out using that channel and the tokens will be settled and payed out to the participating nodes

#### Leave a Token Network, Close all Channels and Settle the Token Amount

1. Click **"LEAVE NETWORK"** for the token network you'd like to leave
2. Click **"Confirm"** to finalize leaving the network. The same thing will happen here as if you would choose to close a channel with the difference that leaving the network will automatically close and settle all channels that belong to that network

The main things you would want to do when using Raiden, let's walk through that flow... Join a Token Network, Make a Payment, Close a Channel and Settle. In the process you will learn what tokens, token networks and channels are



When I re-allocate tokens is any of my ETH consumed because it is syncing the newly allocated amount to the blockchain?

**What is  the use case for providing your own tokens is it for people who build on Raiden? - Need to deploy a smart contract.**

   * Your current **Balance** of a specific token
   * Buttons where you can **Join Network** or **Mint Token**
3. A **Filter** field where you can search for a registered token by its name or address and a **Sort by** dropdown for sorting your list of tokens
4. A **+** button where you can register tokens

#### Channels

In **Channels** you'll find:

1. A list of all your open channels
2. Details about each open channel which includes:
   * The address of the **Partner** node that you have an open channel with
   * The address of the token when you hover over the token symbol \(**WIZ** in the example screenshot\)
   * The current token **Balance** of your Raiden node for a specific channel
   * Your channels **Status** \(Opened, Closed or Settled\)
   * Buttons where you can **Pay**, **Deposit**, **Withdraw** or **Close** a channel

**What is a Channel?**

A channel or payment channel allows Raiden transfers to be made back and forth between parties without involving the actual blockchain.

This works by first creating an initial on-chain deposit of a set amount. The net sum of this amount can then be used in the Raiden off-chain transactions.

We only need to involve the actual blockchain in the initial setup or if we choose to close a channel and settle the netted amount.
{% endhint %}

#### Address Book

In the **Address Book** you'll find:

1. A list of all your saved addresses
2. Two options for saving new addresses:
   * Type the address and label manually
   * Drag and drop a JSON file containing your addresses
